I think that shikaco's brother's birthday is feburary 9th, 1983.
Nanjolno wanted to marry shikaco's brother because of coincidences between them.
Ultimately Nanjolno did not marry him because she tried to give him hints that she is Satoshi Nakamoto.
But, when she ask him about who he thinks is Satoshi Nakamoto, he gets it wrong.

Nanjolno choose him because first coincidence with his birthday is with Ayane Sakura (who played Alisa Ayase in love live)
The coincidence is that Ayane is born on the 29th day of the year. While Shikaco's brother is born on 2/9. 
Another coincidence is that the year 1983 is prophetic like 1984 and also exist in schwarzesmarken.
Another coincidence is that the number of days from her birthday is 271 which is e estimation.

Another coincidence is shikaco herself.
shikaco played the german girl in girl's last tour.
shikaco's birthday is may 19 1989

Her birthyear is exactly 100 years from fuhrer's birthday.
and may 19 is almost april 20. 
also april 20 is weed day. weed is a green plant. her love live symbol is green and is a plant because rice
5+19=4+20


Nanjolno collaborated with shikaco so much because Nanjolno had believed that shikaco would be the next fuhrer or something.
the number of days between shikaco and her brother's birthday is divisible by 29 (also a coincidence). It is a semiprime.

A even bigger coincidence is that between her birthday and Nanjolno's birthday is 1772 days. It factors out to 2^2 times 443.
443 is the 86th prime. 86 is important in informatics because x86
the 2s are powers of 2
2 times 443 is 886 which looks like 86
also bytearrays are displayed as /x which means 8 turns into a byte and then you get x86

Also may 19 is 139th day of the year. 139 is the 34th prime number. Nanjolno connects 34 to rule 34 which makes her think about shikaco's brother
A reason why january 17 is shikaco's character's birthday is that it is the 348th day before a year. 348 factors to 2^2 times 3 times 29. 29 appears.

Nanjoulno created the orange bitcoin logo that we now use to this day.
The reason why is that she was inspired by the fripside logo and toaru kagaku no railgun.
Both logos were orange and white. She decides that bitcoin would also be orange and white.
She created the user 'bitboy' on bitcoin talk to show off the logo.
She botted other users to make it widely accepted.

Nanjoulno is also Housemaster. She played on Gary's mod in the 2000s. 
After going into bitcoin. She decides that she not want to coincide bitcoin with Housemaster.
She decided to keep the legacy with creating a minecraft server.


edit:
I believe Nanjolno belongs to me. It would be a dissapointment if she is not Satoshi Nakamoto.
I will not work. I will not earn money. I will not do any post graduate studies.
When I run out of my parents money, I will leach from the government.
I belong to lots of money. And, will act accordingly. 
I would rather starve to death. 
My first kiss will be from nanjolno. Satoshi Nakamoto should choose whoever discovers.
Before ever finding out that Nanjolno is Satoshi Nakamoto, I have been rejected by 12 diffrent girls. 
A girlfriend lasting only 2 days is still a rejection.
So the promise from me doesn't even matter, it is too easy to keep.

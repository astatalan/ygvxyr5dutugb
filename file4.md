Nanjoulno created the orange bitcoin logo that we now use to this day.
The reason why is that she was inspired by the fripside logo and toaru kagaku no railgun.
Both logos were orange and white. She decides that bitcoin would also be orange and white.
She created the user 'bitboy' on bitcoin talk to show off the logo.
She botted other users to make it widely accepted.

Nanjoulno is also Housemaster. She played on Gary's mod in the 2000s. 
After going into bitcoin. She decides that she not want to coincide bitcoin with Housemaster.
She decided to keep the legacy with creating a minecraft server.


edit:
I believe Nanjolno belongs to me. It would be a dissapointment if she is not Satoshi Nakamoto.
I will not work. I will not earn money. I will not do any post graduate studies.
When I run out of my parents money, I will leach from the government.
I belong to lots of money. And, will act accordingly. 
I would rather starve to death. 
My first kiss will be from nanjolno. Satoshi Nakamoto should choose whoever discovers.
Before ever finding out that Nanjolno is Satoshi Nakamoto, I have been rejected by 12 diffrent girls. 
A girlfriend lasting only 2 days is still a rejection.
So the promise from me doesn't even matter, it is too easy to keep, it is forced.

The reason why I was intrested in Nanjolno before I discovered that she is satoshi Nakamoto
is that milky holmes mocked me for wanting to be a farmer when i grow up in season 2 episode 1.
I thought what I should be. I decide I should list my major as international relations at harvard.
Becuase that was the only academic stuff that was in milky holmes, and Nanjolno's character is connected to harvard.
I wasn't going to go to harvard. I was going to marry nanjolno. 
because if I went to harvard but didn't get nanjolno,
that would be a cringey  romantic novel fan that got inspiration to get something average.
I apply to harvard and 1 easy college only. I wrote both my harvard college essays on minecraft. 
I didn't write for the easy college. I didn't get in. 
Since harvard and international relations were only suppose to be decorations,
I choose computer science in the easy college, to convince my parents to give me money.
Nanjolno is still a required in life for me. I wrote more minecraft for her.
A coincidence that can be made in the future is that both mimorin's and Nanjolno's lovers
became intrested because of milky holmes. I did more holmes-like stuff than sherlock holmes.
Milky as in sea men.

It wasn't the first time writting about milky holmes, but it was the first that I wrote about Nanjolno in milky holmes.
